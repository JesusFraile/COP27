# Narrative and Strategic Communication Analysis on COP27 Tweets

## Description
This repository presents a system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to identify narratives and strategic communication objectives within a dataset related to the COP27 (27th United Nations Climate Change Conference).

The input of both systems is a set of Tweets provided by the user for analysis, and the output is the set of narratives and strategic communication intentions that each Tweet explicitly or implicitly promotes or supports.
